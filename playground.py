# Design a parking lot management system for a multi-level parking lot that allows vehicles to enter, park, and exit. The system should support the following functionalities:
# Vehicle Entry:
# The system should allow different types of vehicles such as cars, motorcycles, and trucks to enter the parking lot.
# Each vehicle should be assigned a unique ticket or ID upon entry.
# The system should keep track of available parking spots for each vehicle type.
# Parking:
# When a vehicle enters the parking lot, it should be allocated an available parking spot based on its type (car, motorcycle, or truck).
# If there are no available spots for a particular vehicle type, the vehicle should not be allowed to enter.
# Vehicle Exit:
# Vehicles leaving the parking lot should be able to pay for their parking time.
# Once payment is completed, the parking spot should be marked as available for the specific vehicle type.
# Design the classes, relationships, and methods needed for this parking lot management system. Consider factors like scalability, modularity, extensibility, and efficiency in your design.
